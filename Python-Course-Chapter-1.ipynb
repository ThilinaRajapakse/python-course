Without seperate environments, we cannot install the necessary version of *packageC* without breaking one of the two projects. With conda environments, we can have one environment with version 1.0 of *packageC* for *projectA*, while another environment has version 2.0 of *packageC* for *projectB*, resolving the issue."
